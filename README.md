### Find what to watch

Have you ever gone on your favorite movie streaming site and kept browsing trying to find what to watch?
Internally you're doing a filtered search
- "I already saw this movie"
- "That one sucks"
- "Oh yea I remember that movie"
- "This movie is really good"

Popcorn's goal is to bring that internal filtering to light.
It will save the movies you like and hide the ones you already know you don't like.
On top of that it will recommend the top movies and movies from your favorite genre as seen from what movies you have already saved.
